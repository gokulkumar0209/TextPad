# Textpad

Textpad is a powerful find-and-replace tool designed for working with paragraphs of text. Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, it provides a fast, modern, and efficient environment for text manipulation.

## Prerequisites

   Run the following command in the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```

## Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or another available port). The server will reload automatically as you edit files.

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.
